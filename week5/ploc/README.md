## Introduction

Ploc is an application written in Python by Jesse Amarquaye during Industrial Attachment at Ghana Grid Company(GRIDCo).

The purpose of this application is to print the number of lines of code in a file.

## Getting Started

To run the application you first have to clone the repo.

### Clone The Repo

Run this _command_:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarquaye/gridco.git
```

Then _change directory_ into the folder

```bash
cd gridco/week5/ploc
```

### Run the application

To run the application you just have to use this approach:

Type python main.py followed by name of the file.

Just make sure that the argument you enter is a valid filename.

Like this:

```bash
python ploc.py <file-to-print-lines-of-code>
```

### Note

The application is case-sensitive so **file** is not the same as **File** or **FILE**.
