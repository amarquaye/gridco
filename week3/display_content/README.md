## Introduction

Display Content an application written in Python by Jesse Amarquaye during Industrial Attachment at Ghana Grid Company(GRIDCo).

The purpose of this application is to display the contents of a file or folder.

## Getting Started

To run the application you first have to clone the repo.

### Clone The Repo

Run this *command*:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarquaye/gridco.git
```

Then *change directory* into the folder

```bash
cd gridco/week3/display_content
```

### Run the application

To run the application you just have to use this approach:

Type python dc.py followed by name of the file.

Just make sure that the argument you enter is a valid filename or folder.

Like this:

```bash
python dc.py [file-or-folder-to-display-content]
```

### Note

The application is case-sensitive so **file** is not the same as **File** or **FILE**.
