## Introduction

Folder Creator is an application written in Python by Jesse Amarquaye during Industrial Attachment at Ghana Grid Company(GRIDCo).

The purpose of this application is to create folders in the command line or terminal.

It is similar in purpose to mkdir.

## Getting Started

To run the application you first have to clone the repo.

### Clone The Repo

Run this *command*:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarquaye/gridco.git
```

Then change directory into the folder:

```bash
cd gridco/week2/folder_creator
```

### Run the application

To run the application you just have to use this approach.
Type python *mkfol.py* followed by any number of arguments.
Just make sure that the arguments you enter are valid folder-names.

Like this:

```bash
python mkfol.py [folder-to-create]
```

Or if you want to create multiple folders:

```bash
python mkfol.py [folder1] [folder2] [folder3] [folder...]
```

### Note

The application is case-sensitive so **folder** is not the same as **Folder** or **FOLDER**.
