The purpose of this application is to create folders iin the command line or terminal.<br>
It is similar in purpose to mkdir.

```
Then change directory into the folder

cd gridco/week2/folder_creator
```

### Run the application
To run the application you just have to use this approach.<br>
Type python main.py followed by any number of arguments.<br>
Just make sure that the arguments you enter are valid folder-names.<br>

Like this:

```
Or if you want to create multiple folders:
