## Introduction

File Remover is an application written in Python by Jesse Amarquaye during Industrial Attachment at Ghana Grid Company(GRIDCo).

The purpose of this application is to remove unwanted files and save precious space(memory).

## Getting Started

To run the application you first have to clone the repo.

### Clone The Repo

Run this _command_:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarquaye/gridco.git
```

Then _change directory_ into the folder:

```bash
cd gridco/week2/file_remover
```

### Run the application

To run the application you just have to use this approach:
Type python _remove.py_ followed by any number of arguments.
Just make sure that the arguments you enter are valid filenames.

Like this:

```bash
python remove.py [file-to-remove]
```

Or if you want to remove multiple files:

```bash
python remove.py <file1> <file2> <file3> <file...>
```

### Note

The application is case-sensitive so **file** is not the same as **File** or **FILE**.
