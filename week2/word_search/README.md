## Introduction
Word Search is an application written in Python by Jesse Amarquaye during Industrial Attachment at Ghana Grid Company(GRIDCo).

## Getting Started
To run the application you first have to clone the repo.

### Clone The Repo
Run this *command*:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarquaye/gridco.git
```
Then change directory into the folder
```bash
cd gridco/week2/word_search
```

### Run the application
To run the application you just have to use this approach.<br>
Type python main.py followed by two arguments, the word you want to search for and then the name of the file to search in.<br>
Like this:
```bash
python main.py [word] [filename]
```
Or a better way of doing it with a realworld example:
```bash
python main.py hello testfile.txt
```

### Note
The application is case-sensitive so 'hello' is not the same as 'Hello' or 'HELLO'.
